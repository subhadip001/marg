          In the context of heritage conservation, preservation pertains to
          properties that have been preserved in their largely intact form, and
          are representative of the period of significance. This includes
          historic roads/routes and related resources that have maintained their
          original design and materials in a good state of repair. The
          preservation approach primarily involves activities and measures that
          focus on maintenance and upkeep of such resources.
